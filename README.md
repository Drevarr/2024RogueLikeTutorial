RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial Starting July 9th 2024

Roguelikedev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial is back again for its eighth year. It will start in one week on Tuesday July 9th. The goal is the same this year - to give roguelike devs the encouragement to start creating a roguelike and to carry through to the end.

Like last year, we'll be following https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/. The tutorial is written for Python+libtcod but, If you want to tag along using a different language or library you are encouraged to join as well with the expectation that you'll be blazing your own trail.

The series will follow a once-a-week cadence. Each week a discussion post will link to that week's Complete Roguelike Tutorial sections as well as relevant FAQ Fridays posts. The discussion will be a way to work out any problems, brainstorm ideas, share progress and any tangential chatting.

If you like, the Roguelike(dev) discord's #roguelikedev-help channel is a great place to hangout and get tutorial help in a more interactive setting.

Hope to see you there :)
